# Big Bad Module Manager

A module management tool for FoundryVTT. 

This module was inspired by [Module Management+](https://github.com/mouse0270/module-credits/), which has not been updated since v9 and finally broke in v13. This module aims to replicate those features for v13.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module is currently in beta and does not quite have a full feature set yet. I **HIGHLY ADVISE** you to make a backup before testing this module.
> Please [report any issues here](https://github.com/thejoester/bbmm/issues)!
