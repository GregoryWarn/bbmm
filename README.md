# Big Bad Module Manager

A module management tool for FoundryVTT. 

This module was inspired by [Module Management+](https://github.com/mouse0270/module-credits/), which has not been updated since v9 and finally broke in v13. This module aims to replicate those features for v13.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module is currently in beta and does not quite have a full feature set yet. I **HIGHLY ADVISE** you to make a backup before testing this module.
> Please [report any issues here](https://github.com/thejoester/bbmm/issues)!

## Contribute

If you would like to contribute to the localization, the best way is to [fork the repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0) (copy master branch only). Then download the [en.json](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/blob/master/lang/en.json) file, rename it to the language code or language (for example es.json or spanish.json for Spanish language), then edit the file translating the text in quotes on the RIGHT SIDE of the colon. When done upload the new language file to your fork in the **lang** folder, then click the "Contribute" button and "Open Pull Request".

If you do not want to go through the fork process, you can also open up an [Issue](https://github.com/thejoester/pf2e-alchemist-remaster-ducttape/issues) and upload the file there.
